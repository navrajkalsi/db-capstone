PLEASE READ BEFORE REVIEWING!!!!
The repository contains the database as well as the syntax of all the quering preformed(both screenshots and the actual code)
please review the code, as I was not able to get Workbench to implement the procedures.
Furthemore, I was unable to find the excel sheet for little lemon so I used the sheet provided to us in the previous course.
The syntaxes are in the 'Syntax folder' and only the Tableau and Jupyter files are not in a folder, rest all files are in the 'db_capstone' folder.
SO PLEASE KINDLY COOPERATE!
THANKS!!
